# rock-paper-scissors-project

03/06/23 Created this project!

03/14/23 Finished this project! Below are some final thoughts

This project was challenging, but generally very fun! I think I did well for
my first project and went out of the box for some concepts simply because
I thought it was fitting to what I wanted to do; I felt like this was MY 
project!

By the time I'm writing this I have successfully met all the marks by TOP
and myself on what a functioning Rock Paper Scissors Game would work like in
a browser. I may have over complicated the steps and processes to get there 
initially, but I'm sure that's a muscle I'll grow as I move on to more programming projects.

There are a few final things I wish I added in before I'll call this final commit:

1) I wish I made the prompts tidier and less repetitive.
I had attempted to do so but I'm not too sure how to embed a function in a string to alert certain outcomes together. I've decided to leave this off to future me. If you're reading, hi!

2) I wish I added a few "What If..." situational code into the functions. What if someone didn't put a value into the prompt? (comment in scripts.js, line 18)
What if they put a wrong value into the prompt? 
What if the value inputted was too long or too short to be recognized at all? What if the loop HAD continued for 100 rounds, how would I more efficiently deal with that before the rounds get to 100 rounds in the first place?
This may be out of the scope of what I should be focusing on at this moment, but I think it's healthy to think about how I could fulfill these situations.

3) I'm actually not 100% sure if the function getComputerChoice() only gets numbers 1-99 and not including 100.

4) I hated writing the function userInputFormatter() in the way that I did (taking the first character, middle characters, and the last characters.)
I didn't want to do it like that I just didn't know how to take only the first character and the rest of the characters! I knew once upon a time but patooie I forgor

5) I think in the function pointGiver(), lines 87 and 88 are redundant and don't need to be there. I'm not to sure how well code that is just there "to make sure" is treated in JavaScript, but I decided to leave it in just in case.
