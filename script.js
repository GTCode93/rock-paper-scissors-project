/* 
Problem: Write a function named getComputerChoice that will randomly choose between three options: 'Rock', 'Paper', or 'Scissors'

No user interface
Desired output is Rock Paper or Scissors
No user input, the code must randomly give either of the three output randomly

Pseudocode:
getComputerChoice is a function with no parameters
let number be a variable
number takes on a random integer with Math.random and Math.floor (USING * 100, THE OUTCOME WILL NEVER BE 100, JUST 99 AND BELOW)

if number is <= 33, then return computerChoice is "Rock"
else if number is <= 66, then return computerChoice is "Paper"
else number is <= 99, then return computerChoice is "Scissors"
